# learningpython
This is my crash course approach to learning Python.
As a Network Engineer, I want to become a coder. I signed up for a 1 year subscription with Boot.dev after hearing about it on The Lex Freeman podcast.
 With a background in Cisco, Juniper, BASH, and Cybersecurity...learning is fun.
 On my off days, its about Movement and Meditiaton.
